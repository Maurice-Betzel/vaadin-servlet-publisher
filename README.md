# vaadin-osgi-servlet-tracker

Forked from https://github.com/vaadin/framework/tree/master/osgi-integration this contains some fixes and additions to it and will be published as a separate addon under a different name.

This is from the perspective of a primarily Vaadin developer with some exposure to OSGi but not an OSGi developer. A non-trivial application build with this module in mind can be found in https://github.com/mmerruko/vaadin8-osgi-dashboard-experiment
